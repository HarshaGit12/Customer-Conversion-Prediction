# Customer-Conversion-Prediction
## Problem Statement
### We are given the historical marketing data of the insurance company and are required to build a ML model that will predict if a client will subscribe to the insurance. 
# Project Overview:
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis is done and Feature Importance is also shown
### 2. Three Classification Algorithms - Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost Classifier are used to model the data
### 3. Out of the 3 Classification models, Random Forest gives better Au-ROC score of 0.989, hence this model is chosen
### 4. Code is also written to take input from user and give prediction
